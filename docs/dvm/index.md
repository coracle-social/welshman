# @welshman/dvm

`@welshman/dvm` is a comprehensive package for building and interacting with Data Vending Machines (DVMs) in the Nostr ecosystem. It provides both server-side DVM implementation capabilities and client-side request handling.

## What is a DVM?

A Data Vending Machine (DVM) is a Nostr service that:
- Listens for specific kinds of events
- Processes these events according to defined rules
- Responds with new events containing processed data
- Optionally provides progress updates during processing


## Installation

```bash
npm install @welshman/dvm
```
