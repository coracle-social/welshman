# What is Welshman?

Welshman is a production-grade nostr toolkit powering [Coracle](https://coracle.social) and [Flotilla](https://flotilla.social).
Built as independent, opt-in packages, it lets you choose exactly what you need - from basic event handling to complete feed management.

Need just a content parser? Grab @welshman/content. Building a complex client? Start with @welshman/app and add more packages as you grow.

Each module is battle-tested in production, designed to work together but never dependent on each other.

Build your next Nostr client with the same tools that power today's leading Nostr applications.

<!-- ## Installation

```sh
npm install @welshman
``` -->
